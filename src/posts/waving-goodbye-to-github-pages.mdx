# Waving goodbye to Github Pages

Written on May 6th in the year 2019.

For the last little while I've hosted this website on Github Pages and it's been great. It's super easy to setup, and super easy to deploy to. For these reasons it'd be easy to wonder why one should ever choose to move away from it. To be honest, I don't necessarily have a reason I can give as to why AWS is a better alternative for something like this. A small, personal website really doesn't need the scalability, options, or infrastructure that AWS offers. Indeed, it's probably overkill. However, since I did decide to move this site off of Github Pages and onto AWS, I thought I'd lay out some of the benefits AWS gives you:

1. AWS S3 has something like 99.9999% uptime. It hardly ever goes down.
2. AWS S3 for static websites is exceptionally scalable. Because all the content is static, you don't necessarily have to worry about load balance when site traffic increases. 
3. S3 plays really well with Cloudfront. Cloudfront allows you to set up a global CDN with relative ease. 
4. You can integrate Cloudfront with Lambda@Edge to run Node.js functions. 

The thing to bear in mind here is that these benefits apply to websites much larger and much more heavily trafficked than a humble personal blog. For that reason, I thought it was a good idea to learn how to use AWS. The focus here is more on the tools used than the reason for using them. Experience and knowledge of how to create a highly scalable and resilient site infrastructure is an invaluable thing to have in your toolbox. 

## Tools Used

I briefly mentioned above some of the tools AWS has that make it an attractive holistic solution to creating site infrastructure. Specifically, we're going to use these three:

1. S3 - Perhaps less known by its longer name, Amazon Simple Storage Service, is a service that provides object storage through a web service interface. S3 uses the same scalable infrastructure that Amazon.com uses to run its e-commerce network.
2. CloudFront - A content delivery network. Content delivery networks provide a globally distributed network of proxy servers which cache content more locally for consumers, allowing for improved access speed when downloading content. 
3. Route 53 - DNS service provided by Amazon. Technically for this exercise any DNS can be used, but Route 53 plays a little more nicely with other Amazon web services than a third party one.
