# Learning from Saint Francis

Written on March 20 in the year 2019.

Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;
where there is darkness, light;
where there is sadness, joy.

O divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek
to be consoled as to console,
to be understood as to understand, 
to be loved as to love.
For it is in giving that we receive,
it is in pardoning that we are pardoned, 
and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.
Amen.

Regardless of your views or beliefs, it's easy to agree that most, or all, of what Saint Francis mentions above is inherently good. In asking myself the questions "how can I become a better person?" or "How can I become a better husband?" or "how can I become a better teammate to my co-workers?", Saint Francis offers a simple yet incredibly profound and hard-to-achieve answer: be selfless and give of yourself to doing good. The world becomes net positive when we commit to being for one another.
