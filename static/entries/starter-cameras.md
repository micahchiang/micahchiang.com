# Building StarterCameras And What Comes After

Written on July 24th in the year 2019.

About 4 years ago I purchased the domain [startercameras.com](startercameras.com) with the intention of building some sort of project out of it. I never did. I bounced back and forth between different ideas and how viable each one was. When I finally picked an idea I was excited about, I ruminated on the different technolgies I could learn and use to build out the project. 

Now, in the back half of 2019, I've finally finished V1 of [startercameras.com](startercameras.com) after changing up how I approach building personal projects. Going back to that piece about thinking long on tools to use, I learned about myself earlier this year that if I spent too much time focusing on idea implementation, I would never actually get around to building. Maybe this has already has a known term, but I'll call it idea paralysis for now. 

In recognizing this tendency towards idea paralysis I started asking myself the question "What is the easiest win I can get right now?"
